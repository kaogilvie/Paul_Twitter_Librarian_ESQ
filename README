Paul steps into the light from between the bookshelves, flapping their wings
and tweeting incessantly. Feathers stick out from the pages, plumes swirling
in the dim, dusty, Pagemaster-esque cinematography.
"Hello, there, sir madam or other. How may I be of assistance?"
Paul is a tall, skinny fellow, horn rimmed glasses and chock-full of librarian 
cliche stuffiness. But in his hand he holds a stylus and on his belt a tiny bow 
and arrow, as if the Smurf's Cupid had decided that, above all the people in the 
world, Paul should be the one to help him fulfill the tedious business of Smurf 
procreation.
"[Insert pronoun of choice here]?"
Paul takes off his glasses to wipe them on his shirt.
"Well....do you want to see what I've been working on?"
Paul smiles and whirls. You step through the feathers to follow him.

"It's quite simple," Paul tells you an hour later after he's untucked his shirt and 
offered you a whiskey and coke. "I want to find an easy way to collate the things 
that people you respect--the ones you tell me you respect, or at least, are 
hilariously intrigued by--and put them into a nice widget y'all can slap on your 
website. Sounds good, eh?"
Paul takes the nod as a sign to continue.
"It's just taking longer than I had hoped. The snake keeps eating the birds...it's
a problem of husbandry, I think. Well, anyone would think that. You're a herpetologist,
are you not? Oh, PYTHONs only? Great. You'll be of great use for this one then."

Paul leans back in his chair. "Tell you what. I'll give a holler when I've got 
the bare bones down here. Then you can weigh in all you want. Thanks for coming to see me."
