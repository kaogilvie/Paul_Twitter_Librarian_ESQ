Paul steps into the light from between the bookshelves, flapping their wings
and tweeting incessantly. Feathers stick out from the pages, plumes swirling
in the dim, dusty, Pagemaster-esque cinematography.

"Hello, there, sir madam or other. How may I be of assistance?"

Paul is a tall, skinny fellow, horn rimmed glasses and chock-full of librarian 
cliche stuffiness. But in his hand he holds a stylus and on his belt a tiny bow 
and arrow, as if the Smurf's Cupid had decided that, above all the people in the 
world, Paul should be the one to help him fulfill the tedious business of Smurf 
procreation.

"[Insert pronoun of choice here]?"

Paul takes off his glasses to wipe them on his shirt.

"Well....do you want to see what I've been working on?"

Paul smiles and whirls. You step through the feathers to follow him.

"It's quite simple," Paul tells you an hour later after he's untucked his shirt and 
offered you a whiskey and coke. "I want to find an easy way to collate the things 
that people you respect--the ones you tell me you respect, or at least, are 
hilariously intrigued by--and put them into a nice widget y'all can slap on your 
website. Sounds good, eh?"

Paul takes the nod as a sign to continue.

"It's just taking longer than I had hoped. The snake keeps eating the birds...it's
a problem of husbandry, I think. Well, anyone would think that. You're a herpetologist,
are you not? Oh, PYTHONs only? Great. You'll be of great use for this one then."

Paul leans back in his chair. "Tell you what. I'll give a holler when I've got 
the bare bones down here. Then you can weigh in all you want. Thanks for coming to see me."

You tap Paul on the head. He's facedown on a dusty book, drool pooling everywhere.

"Who--what--who--" Paul sits up, clamping his glasses back on his face. "Uh, yes there has been a lot of work being done here on various things, thanks for coming, library is temporarily closed--"

Paul realizes, 'Hey, you're that person from before, aren't you?' He doesn't say it. You can just read the realization on his brain.

He begins flipping through the book he was using as a pillow, sheepishly. "I mean, I don't have much to show just yet. It's all in offline mode, so I'm still working on the inital development. Collating stuff like this....it's just taking me a while to marshall my thoughts, alright? And what with the new expansion of the library, the fire in the Horror section and the visit from the Board of Trustees, it's a boon that I got even THIS much done."

You expected better of Paul. Your eyes show it.

"Hey, listen, I didn't ask for your judgment eyes. I know I'm going to get them anyway. I'm doing this as fast as I can, I've just got...er...some other things. Going on right now." There is a small black soot mark on Paul's arm, above which you can see some dried blood. Come to think of it, Paul does look a little more harrassed than just a Board of Trustees meeting...

"Come back in a few?"


***

Carrying a box of eggs home from the corner story, you see there's a light on in the library. On a whim, you turn into the parkinglot and notice that there's a small piece of paper tacked to the outside of the grand double doors.

"Welcome to the Annals!!!!!" it proclaims, abusing its exclamation point privileges like it was in high school. The door creaks open and light pools on the blacktop. Peeking inside, you find Paul sprawled out on the floor, flasks of alcohol uncorked and half finished. There's gibberish scrawled in black ink all over the floor and stacks.

"What the..."
